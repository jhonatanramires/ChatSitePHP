# ChatSitePHP
simple chat site with users done with LAMP(Linux Apache Mysql Php) stack 

# configs
1. you must create a subdirectory called "images" in the directory "php" for save the profile images, use this command in the repository directory: mkdir ./php/images.

2. the only thing that is missing is the configuration of the mysql database, i will update this repository with the configs some day :D
